# ON THE MOVE

Creates a modern application that helps users track their workouts on a map

## Idea Behind it

The purpose of this application was to enable users to easily track their workouts on a map by dropping pins.
The app would also store valuable metrics such as the distance, pace, speed, etc. Users could both add running
activities as well as cycling.

## Features

- APP retrives local position of user and diplays the map for their area
- User can click anywhere on the map to drop a pin
- Checks valid user inputs, for example distance must be a positive number
- Nice visuals to go along with the application
- Store the workouts in local storage so that the user can access it later
- Unlimited workouts can be added
- Tracks the current date the workout was added
